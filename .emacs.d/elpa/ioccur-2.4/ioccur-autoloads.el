Incremental search of lines in current buffer matching input.
With a prefix arg search symbol at point (INITIAL-INPUT).

While you are incremental searching, commands provided are:

C-n or <down>  next line.
C-p or <up>    precedent line.
C-v and M-v    scroll up and down.
C-z or <right> jump without quitting loop.
C-j or <left>  jump and kill `ioccur-buffer'.
RET            exit keeping `ioccur-buffer'.
DEL            remove last character entered.
C-k            Kill current input from cursor to eol.
C-a/e/b/f      Movements in minibuffer.
M-k            Kill current input as sexp.
C-w            Yank stuff at point.
C-g            quit and restore buffer.
C-s            Toggle split window.
C-:            Toggle regexp/litteral search.
C-down         Follow in other buffer.
C-up           Follow in other buffer.
M-p/n          Precedent and next `ioccur-history' element.
M-<, M->       Beginning and end of buffer.

Unlike minibuffer history, cycling in ioccur history have no end:

M-p ,-->A B C D E F G H I---,
    |                       |
    `---I H G F E D C B A<--'

M-n ,-->I H G F E D C B A---,
    |                       |
    `---A B C D E F G H I<--'


Special NOTE for terms:
=======================
  tab/S-tab are bound to history.
  C-d/u are for following in other buffer.
  Use C-t to Scroll up.

When you quit incremental search with RET, see `ioccur-mode'
for commands provided in the `ioccur-buffer'.
