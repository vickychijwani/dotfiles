ruby-mode. It includes various handy functions that will improve
your productivity.

To use ruby-tools-mode, make sure that this file is in Emacs load-path:
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/directory/or/file")

Then require ruby-tools:
  (require 'ruby-tools)

ruby-tools-mode is automatically started in ruby-mode.
